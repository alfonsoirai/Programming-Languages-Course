# Final Project: Tic Tac Toe

## Description

This project consists on the implementation of the TicTacToe game using the Prolog Programming Language and Java for the Graphic User Interface.

## Objective

Being able to implement a logical programming language with some other that we already are used to work with.

## Setup

You will need to have the last version of Java installed, if you dont have it, you can download it in the following link: [https://www.java.com/en/download/](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

Also, you need to have Swipl-Prolog installed. You can download it here: [http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html](http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html)

Once you installed Java ans Swipl-Prolog, you can need to go to the `TicTacToe.java` file and go to line 151 and indicate your script command to execute swipl-prolog. In my case:
```
/usr/local/bin/swipl
```

On the next line (152), you need to indicate the directory of the Prolog file (main.pl). If you clone the directory such as it is, you can leave it the way it is.

## Execute

It's really simple to execute the TicTacToe. You need to go to you terminal and go all the way to the directory where you have the files downloaded.

i.e.
```
cd ..
```

Whenever you are in the directory, you can execute the make commands.

### Make commands
To compile and execute:
```
make default
```
To just compile:
```
make compile
```
To only run the program (after it's compiled, of course):
```
make run
```
